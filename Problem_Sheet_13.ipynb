    "1. Fix the number of clusters $K$ and assign (by random) a number, from $1$ to $K$, to each of the observations. These serve as initial cluster assignments for the observations.\n",
    "2. Iterate until the cluster assignments stop changing:\n",
    "  1. For each of the $K$ clusters, compute the cluster centroid. The $k$-th cluster centroid is the vector of the $p$ feature means for the observations in the $k$-th cluster.\n",
    "  2. Assign each observation to the cluster whose centroid is closest (where closest is defined by Euclidean distance).\n",
